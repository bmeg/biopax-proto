Definition: An interaction in which participants bind physically to
each other, directly or indirectly through intermediary molecules.
Rationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced
by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail
required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what
is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-
world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes.
Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured
in BioPAX using this class.    Usage: This class should be used by
default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined
by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction
should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the
few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated
with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the
interaction class description). If all participants are known with
exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead.
Example: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid

that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any
indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most
large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens.

/*
Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical
entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share
common physical properties and often named and treated as a single
entity with multiple states by biologists.   Rationale:   Many
protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view,
and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability
with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of
molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example
cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the
cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and
Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for
small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.  Usage:
Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules
in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database
cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated
in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a
phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein
(child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins,
including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to
all of them and common references to protein databases containing more
information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.
Comments: This grouping has three semantic implications:  1.  Members
of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties.
This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of
molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary
information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation
terms and database identifiers.  2. A small number of transitions
seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and
frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to
another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an
extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become
phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53
becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a
nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of
synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about
the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and
remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation
and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component
is a reference entity.  3. Some of the pools in the same group can
overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the
experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state
variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible
combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the
molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However
no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups.

/*
Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a
catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering
its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing
between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion. Rationale:
Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by
lowering the activation energy. Physiologically, however, it can have
a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For
example, the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate
dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under physiological
conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed
from the system.     Usage: A separate catalysis instance should be
created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may
catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a
conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two
different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those
biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis
class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple different organisms
could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a
biochemical reaction is generic if it only includes small molecules).
Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of
this class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed
reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known, a catalysis
instance can be created without a controller specified. Synonyms:
facilitation, acceleration. Examples: The catalysis of a biochemical
reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a
membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a
scaffold protein. Hexokinase -> (The "Glucose + ATP ->
Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase
is an active transporter (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to
pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to
extracellular space would be described in a transport instance. K+
from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a
transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis
instance controlling each of the above transport instances. A
biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological
conditions, but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell
extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in the
extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the
CONTROLLER property empty.

Definition : Genetic interactions between genes occur when two genetic
perturbations (e.g. mutations) have a combined phenotypic effect not
caused by either perturbation alone. A gene participant in a genetic
interaction represents the gene that is perturbed. Genetic
interactions are not physical interactions but logical (AND)
relationships. Their physical manifestations can be complex and span
an arbitarily long duration.   Rationale: Currently,  BioPAX provides
a simple definition that can capture most genetic interactions
described in the literature. In the future, if required, the
definition can be extended to capture other logical relationships and
different, participant specific phenotypes.   Example: A synthetic
lethal interaction occurs when cell growth is possible without either
gene A OR B, but not without both gene A AND B. If you knock out A and
B together, the cell will die.

modification of the physicalentities involved in the ComplexAssembly

to represent complex disassembly. The assembly or disassembly of a
complex is often a spontaneous process, in which case the direction of
the complexAssembly (toward either assembly or disassembly) should be
specified via the SPONTANEOUS property. Conversions in which
participants obtain or lose CovalentBindingFeatures ( e.g.

/*
Definition: The apparent equilibrium constant, K', and associated
values.  Usage: Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation
refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular
biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant
equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to
ADP and inorganic phosphate:  K' = [ADP][P<sub>i</sub>]/[ATP],  The
concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the
following species:  [ATP] = [ATP<sup>4-</sup>] + [HATP<sup>3-</sup>] +
[H<sub>2</sub>ATP<sup>2-</sup>] + [MgATP<sup>2-</sup>] +
[MgHATP<sup>-</sup>] + [Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP].  The apparent equilibrium
constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of
as many of the terms (1 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) in the numerator or
denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic
strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log<sub>10</sub>[Mg<sup>2+</sup>]).
Therefore, these quantities must be specified to be precise, and
values for KEQ for biochemical reactions may be represented as
5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This property may have multiple
values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the
different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple. (This
definition adapted from EcoCyc)  See

/*
Definition: A step in an ordered pathway. Rationale: Some pathways can
have a temporal order. For example,  if the pathway boundaries are
based on a perturbation phenotype link, the pathway might start with
the perturbing agent and end at gene expression leading to the
observed changes. Pathway steps can represent directed compound
graphs. Usage: Multiple interactions may occur in a pathway step, each
should be listed in the stepProcess property. Order relationships
between pathway steps may be established with the nextStep slot. If
the reaction contained in the step is a reversible biochemical
reaction but physiologically has a direction in the context of this
pathway, use the subclass BiochemicalPathwayStep.  Example: A
metabolic pathway may contain a pathway step composed of one
biochemical reaction (BR1) and one catalysis (CAT1) instance, where
CAT1 describes the catalysis of BR1. The M phase of the cell cycle,
defined as a pathway, precedes the G1 phase, also defined as a
pathway.

/*
Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or
otherwise influences a continuant entity, i.e. pathway or interaction.
Usage: Conceptually, physical entities are involved in interactions
(or events) and the events are controlled or modified, not the
physical entities themselves. For example, a kinase activating a
protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually
represented as an 'activation' arrow from the kinase to the substrate
in signaling diagrams. This is an abstraction, called "Activity Flow"
representation,  that can be ambiguous without context. In BioPAX,
this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an
instance of the catalysis class) a Biochemical Reaction in which the
substrate is phosphorylated.  Subclasses of control define types
specific to the biological process that is being controlled and should
be used instead of the generic "control" class when applicable.   A
control can potentially have multiple controllers. This acts as a
logical AND, i.e. both controllers are needed to regulate the
controlled event. Alternatively multiple controllers can control the
same event and this acts as a logical OR, i.e. any one of them is
sufficient to regulate the controlled event. Using this structure it
is possible to describe arbitrary control logic using BioPAX.
Rationale: Control can be temporally non-atomic, for example a pathway
can control another pathway in BioPAX.   Synonyms: regulation,
mediation  Examples: A small molecule that inhibits a pathway by an
unknown mechanism.

Definition: This class represents a term from an external controlled
vocabulary (CV). Rationale: Controlled Vocabularies mark cases where
BioPAX delegates the representation of a complex biological phenomena
to an external controlled vocabulary development effort such as Gene
Ontology. Each subclass of this class represents one such case and
often has an associated "Best-Practice" external resource to use. See
the documentation of each subclass for more specific information.
Correct usage of controlled vocabularies are critical to data exchange
and integration. Usage: The individuals belonging to this class must
unambiguously refer to the source controlled vocabulary. This can be
achieved in two manners: The xref property of this class is restricted
to the unification xref class. It must point to the source controlled
vocabulary. Alternatively the rdf-id of the member individuals can be
set to the designated MIRIAM URN. It is a best practice to do both
whenever possible. Although it is possible to use multiple unification
xrefs to identify semantically identical terms across alternative
controlled vocabularies, this is not a recommended practice as it
might lead to maintenance issues as the controlled vocabularies
change. There is no recommended use-case for directly instantiating

/*
Description: A characteristic of a physical entity that can change
while the entity still retains its biological identity.   Rationale:
Two phosphorylated forms of a protein are strictly speaking different
chemical  molecules. It is, however, standard in biology to treat them
as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely
defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses
captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX
represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule.
This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools
are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single
molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be
considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and
experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features
that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can
also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known
to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be
hierarchically organized into families based on sequence homology so
can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such
hierarchical classifications among entity features.   Usage:
Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances
and should be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for
instantiating  entity feature is, for describing active/inactive
states of proteins where more specific feature information is not
available.    Examples: Open/close conformational state of channel
proteins, "active"/"inactive" states, excited states of photoreactive
groups.

Definition : An entity feature that represent the bound state of a

Rationale: A physical entity in a molecular complex is considered as a
new state of an entity as it is structurally and functionally

states. Similar to other features, a molecule can have bound and not-
bound states.   Usage: Typically, binding features are present in
pairs, each describing the binding characteristic for one of the
interacting physical entities. One exception is using a binding
feature with no paired feature to describe any potential binding. For
example, an unbound receptor can be described by using a "not-feature"
property with an unpaired binding feature as its value.
BindingSiteType and featureLocation allows annotating the binding
location.  IntraMolecular property should be set to "true" if the bond
links two parts of the same molecule. A pair of binding features are
still used where they are owned by the same physical entity.   If the

example, if one wished to link from a database record, C, describing a
